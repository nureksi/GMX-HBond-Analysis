# **Hydrogen Bond Analysis** ðŸš€

This pipeline performs hydrogen bond analysis on a protein structure using GROMACS. It processes residue pairs from a PDB file, calculates hydrogen bonds, filters them based on a threshold, and visualizes the results through line plots.

## **How to Use the Pipeline**

   **Step1: Update the Index File**
   - Run `pdb_to_index.py` to update the existing index file with residue groups from the PDB file.
   - Use the following command:
    
     ```bash
     python pdb_to_index.py
     ```

   **Step 2: Perform Hydrogen Bond Analysis** 
   - Run `hbond_analysis.py` to analyze hydrogen bonds between residue pairs.
   - This will generate `.xvg` files for each pair with bond data.
   - Use the following command:
     ```bash
     python hbond_analysis.py
     ```

   **Step 3: Filter Hydrogen Bonds** 
   - Run `hbond_threshold_filter.py` to filter hydrogen bonds based on a defined threshold.
   - Pairs with hydrogen bonds above the threshold will be saved to `result.txt`.
   - Use this command:
     ```bash
     python hbond_threshold_filter.py
     ```

   **Step 4: Visualize Hydrogen Bonds** 
   - Run `hbond_visualization.py` to generate line plots for each filtered pair.
   - The plots will visualize hydrogen bond counts over time.
   - Use this command:
     ```bash
     python hbond_visualization.py
     ```
